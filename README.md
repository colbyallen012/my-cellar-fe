# My Cellar

This personal project was built to help organize and keep track of the wine a user drinks. I built the backend with postgreSQL and Express.js. That repository can be found here [BE](https://github.com/colbyallen012/My-Cellar). A user can use the My Cellar app to post the bottle that they drink. A user enters the vineyard, the name of the bottle, the color of the wine, the type of wine, the year, and their own personal rating of the bottle. 

## Built With

React

Enzyme and Jest Testing

## Goals

For this project I wanted to work on my backend skills (postgreSQL, Express.js).

Keep my react skills sharp.

Continued practice on connecting front end and back end projects.
